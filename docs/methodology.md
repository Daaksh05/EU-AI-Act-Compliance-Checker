# Methodology

## Research Objective
The objective of this project is to design a system capable of evaluating
AI applications against the regulatory obligations defined by the EU AI Act.

## Approach
A rule-based approach was selected to ensure transparency, interpretability,
and legal alignment.

## Steps
1. Input collection (AI system description)
2. Metadata extraction
3. Risk classification based on EU AI Act categories
4. Compliance evaluation using predefined regulatory rules
5. Report generation

## Justification
A deterministic rule-based system is preferred over black-box models
for legal and regulatory auditing tasks.

## Limitations
- Does not replace legal advice
- Limited to predefined EU AI Act rules
- Relies on text-based descriptions

## Ethical Considerations
The system promotes transparency, accountability, and fairness
in AI system deployment.
